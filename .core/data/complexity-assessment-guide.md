# Complexity Assessment Guide

## Complexity Dimensions

### 1. Domain Complexity (1-5 Scale)

**Score 1 - Single Domain**
- Problem confined to one discipline/area
- Established knowledge base applies directly
- Clear domain boundaries
- Standard approaches available

**Score 2-3 - Multiple Domains**
- Problem spans 2-3 related domains
- Some cross-domain knowledge needed
- Interfaces between domains manageable
- Adaptation of standard approaches required

**Score 4-5 - Cross-Disciplinary/Novel**

- Established coordination mechanisms
- Clear hierarchy or process

**Score 4-5 - Conflicting/Unknown**
- Many stakeholders with competing interests
- Hidden or unknown stakeholders
- Power struggles and politics
- No clear resolution mechanism

### 3. Solution Space Complexity (1-5 Scale)

**Score 1 - Known Solutions**
- Well-established solutions exist
- Clear best practices available
- Implementation straightforward
- Success patterns understood

**Score 2-3 - Adaptation Needed**

- Best practices require customization
- Some innovation in implementation
- Mixed success patterns

**Score 4-5 - Innovation Required**
- No existing solutions available
- Breakthrough innovation needed
- High uncertainty about approach
- Success requires new methods

### 4. Constraint Complexity (1-5 Scale)

**Score 1 - Clear Constraints**

- Some conflicting limitations
- Trade-offs required
- Constraints occasionally change
- Optimization needed

**Score 4-5 - Unknown/Paradoxical**
- Constraints unknown or changing
- Paradoxical requirements
- No clear trade-off framework
- Constraint discovery ongoing

### 5. Uncertainty Complexity (1-5 Scale)

**Score 1 - High Certainty**
- Predictable outcomes
- Historical data available
- Clear cause-effect relationships
- Low environmental volatility

**Score 2-3 - Measurable Risk**
- Known probabilities
- Some historical precedent
- Identifiable risk factors
- Moderate volatility

**Score 4-5 - Deep Uncertainty**
- Unknown probabilities
- No historical precedent
- Unknown unknowns present

## Assessment Guidelines

### Initial Assessment
- Score each dimension independently
- Use examples and evidence to justify scores
- Consider both current and potential complexity
- Document reasoning for scores

### Reassessment Triggers
- New information about stakeholders
- Discovery of additional constraints
- Solution attempts reveal new complexity
- Environmental changes affect problem
- Time pressure changes significantly

### Confidence Levels
- **High**: Clear evidence for all dimensions
- **Medium**: Some assumptions in scoring
- **Low**: Significant unknowns remain

### Common Assessment Errors
- **Underestimating stakeholder complexity**
- **Assuming familiar domains are simple**
- **Not considering constraint interactions**
- **Overconfidence in uncertainty assessment**
- **Anchoring on initial problem framing**
