# Cross-Domain Patterns

## Complexity Assessment Patterns

### Multi-Dimensional Complexity Framework
- **Domains**: Problem-solving, project management, research, decision-making
- **Pattern**: Assess problems across multiple independent dimensions
- **Universal Dimensions**: Domain breadth, stakeholder alignment, solution uncertainty, constraint complexity, uncertainty level
- **Applications**: Resource allocation, method selection, team formation, timeline planning
- **Insight**: Total complexity determines appropriate analytical depth

### Complexity-Adaptive Scaling
- **Domains**: Education, consulting, research, product development
- **Pattern**: Match analytical rigor to problem complexity
- **Scale Mapping**: 
  - Simple (5-8): Linear approaches, standard methods
  - Medium (9-12): Structured analysis, multiple perspectives  
  - Complex (13-16): Deep systematic analysis, synthesis required
  - Wicked (17-20+): Emergent, adaptive approaches, continuous learning
- **Applications**: Method selection, resource planning, quality assurance
- **Insight**: Over/under-engineering analysis leads to inefficiency or failure

### Progressive Complexity Discovery
