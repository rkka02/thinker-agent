# execute-step

## Execution Notice
You are about to execute a **Thinking Step** from your iterative thinking plan. This task enforces step-by-step progression with validation gates, ensuring each step builds on previous insights before advancing.

## Method Description
**Universal Cognitive-Adaptive Iterative Thinking (UCAIT) Execution**: Executes universal thinking steps integrating domain-agnostic cognitive frameworks applicable across all fields - science, philosophy, personal decisions, creative projects, academic research.

**Core Principle**: Enforce disciplined multi-layered thinking combining Polya's universal problem-solving, computational thinking, critical reasoning, lateral thinking, and systems analysis for breakthrough insights across any domain.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
- Cannot skip to later steps without completing prerequisites
- Validation criteria must be met before step completion
- Insights and deliverables captured before progression
- Time awareness without strict enforcement

## Interactive Flow

### Execution Mode Detection
**Auto-Execute Mode**: When called with "auto" parameter, execute all steps sequentially without individual confirmations
**Manual Mode**: Traditional step-by-step execution with confirmations

### Step 1: Validate Execution Context

**Check for Active Thinking Plan**:
If no active plan: "No thinking plan found. Please run '*create-thinking-plan' first."

**Auto-Execute Mode**:
If auto mode: "🚀 EXECUTING FULL THINKING PLAN AUTOMATICALLY..."
- Show plan overview
- Begin sequential execution
- Skip to Step 2A (Auto Execution Loop)

**Manual Mode**:
**Check Current Step Status**:
- If current step already completed: "Step {N} already completed. Use '*plan-status' to see progress or '*execute-step {N+1}' for next step."
- If prerequisite steps incomplete: "Cannot execute Step {N}. Prerequisites not met: {list incomplete steps}"

  2. Address specific missing criteria (Polya/computational/metacognitive/systems/conceptual/lateral)
  3. Deepen specific universal thinking layer that needs more development
  4. Explore cross-domain applications to strengthen universal insights
  5. Mark step as 'sufficient' and proceed (not recommended for optimal cross-domain insight quality)
  6. Request cognitive load adjustment if universal framework seems overwhelming"

### Step 6: Progress Update & Next Actions

**Update Plan State**:
