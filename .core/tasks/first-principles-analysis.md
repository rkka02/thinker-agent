# First Principles Analysis

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:

1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires systematic step-by-step execution
2. **MANDATORY USER INTERACTION** - Each phase must be processed with user engagement
3. **FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE APPLIED** - Break down to fundamentals that cannot be reduced further
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - True first principles requires complete deconstruction

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you skip phases or make assumptions without validation, you have violated first principles thinking.

## Method Overview

First Principles Analysis, exemplified by Richard Feynman and Elon Musk, involves breaking complex problems down to their most fundamental, irreducible elements. As Aristotle defined it, a first principle is "the first basis from which a thing is known."

**Feynman's Core Principle**: "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool."

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Problem Statement Clarification
**Objective**: Strip away all assumptions and get to the raw problem

1. **Present Current Problem Statement**
   - State the problem as currently understood
   - Identify all embedded assumptions
   - List what we "think" we know vs. what we actually know

2. **Challenge Every Assumption Systematically**
   - For each assumption, ask: "How do we know this is true?"
   - Separate facts from beliefs
   - Identify sources of each "fact"

3. **Map Perceived vs. Actual Constraints**
   - What constraints are assumed vs. physics-based?
   - Which limitations are self-imposed vs. fundamental?
   - What "rules" can actually be broken?

### Phase 2: Fundamental Decomposition Process
**Objective**: Reach the irreducible elements

1. **Core Truth Extraction**
   - Ask: "What are we REALLY trying to achieve?"
   - Strip away ALL implementation details
   - Identify the fundamental physics/logic/economics

2. **Irreducible Elements Identification**
   - What cannot be reduced further?
   - What are the true fundamental constraints?
   - What are the basic building blocks?

3. **Causality Chain Mapping**
   - What MUST be true for the desired outcome?
   - What are the necessary vs. sufficient conditions?
   - Where are the real dependencies?

### Phase 3: Reconstruction from Fundamentals
**Objective**: Build up solution from basic truths

1. **Ground-Up Building**
   - Start from identified fundamentals only
   - Add complexity one layer at a time
   - Justify each addition with first principles

2. **Innovation Through Recombination**
   - How can fundamentals combine differently?
   - What novel approaches emerge from basics?
   - Where do new possibilities appear?

3. **Constraint Validation**
   - Which "constraints" disappear under analysis?
   - What new degrees of freedom emerge?
   - How does the solution space expand?

## Interactive Elicitation Points

When `elicit: true`, present these options:

1. **Proceed to next phase** - Continue systematic analysis
2. **Challenge this assumption differently** - Apply alternative questioning approach  
3. **Add another fundamental constraint** - Include additional irreducible element
4. **Explore alternative decomposition** - Try different breakdown approach
5. **Apply physical laws directly** - Use physics/chemistry/biology constraints
6. **Consider economic fundamentals** - Include supply/demand/incentive basics
7. **Question the problem itself** - Challenge whether this IS the real problem
8. **Seek external validation** - Check assumptions against data/experts
9. **Consult domain specialist** - Get expert input on fundamentals

## Method Validation Checklist

Before completing analysis:
- [ ] Have we reached truly irreducible elements?
- [ ] Can any "fundamental" be broken down further?
- [ ] Are we building from physics/logic, not convention?
- [ ] Does the solution violate any true constraints?
- [ ] Have we challenged our biggest assumptions?
- [ ] Is this genuinely different from standard approach?

## Common First Principles Pitfalls

1. **Stopping Too Early**: Accepting reducible elements as fundamental
2. **Industry Thinking**: Using domain conventions as "laws"
3. **Anchoring Bias**: First decomposition becoming permanent
4. **Complexity Bias**: Assuming complex problems need complex solutions
5. **Authority Bias**: Accepting expert opinion as fundamental truth

## Integration with Other Methods

**Combine With**:
- TRIZ: Apply first principles to contradiction resolution
- Systems Thinking: Use fundamentals to identify leverage points
- Design Thinking: Apply to user needs, not just solutions
- Root Cause Analysis: Use to validate true causes

**Follow With**:
- Solution synthesis using identified fundamentals
- Decision analysis weighing first principles insights
- Implementation planning respecting true constraints

## Historical Examples

**SpaceX Rockets**: Conventional wisdom said launch costs were fixed by physics. Musk applied first principles to materials costs: aluminum, titanium, carbon fiber, etc. Result: 10x cost reduction.

**Tesla Batteries**: Industry assumed battery costs were physics-limited. First principles analysis of lithium, cobalt, aluminum costs on commodity markets revealed manufacturing was the constraint.

**Wright Brothers Flight**: While others focused on powerful engines, Wright brothers applied first principles to control and lift, leading to successful powered flight with a weaker engine.

## Success Indicators

- **Paradigm Shift**: Solution approach fundamentally different from status quo
- **Constraint Breaking**: Previously "impossible" things become possible
- **Resource Efficiency**: Dramatic improvement in cost/time/materials
- **Simplicity**: Complex problem has unexpectedly simple fundamental solution
- **Transferability**: Insights apply to other seemingly unrelated problems
