# Plan Adjustment Task

## Purpose
Modify thinking plan based on changing complexity assessment, new constraints, or discovered insights during execution.

## Input Requirements
- Current thinking plan
- Reason for adjustment (complexity change, time constraints, new insights)
- Session progress and captured insights
- New constraints or requirements

## Process
1. **Assessment Review**
   - Re-evaluate problem complexity if needed
   - Identify what triggered adjustment need
   - Review progress against original plan

2. **Adjustment Options**
   - **Step Addition**: Add new steps for discovered complexity
   - **Step Removal**: Remove steps due to time constraints
   - **Step Modification**: Adjust methods or depth within steps
   - **Resequencing**: Change step order based on insights

3. **Impact Analysis**
   - Assess impact on overall timeline
   - Identify which insights may be affected
   - Evaluate trade-offs of proposed changes

4. **Plan Revision**
   - Update thinking plan structure
   - Adjust time estimates
   - Modify step requirements and methods
   - Update success criteria

## Output
- Revised thinking plan with rationale
- Updated timeline and resource requirements
- Modified step definitions and methods
- Impact assessment of changes
- Communication of changes to stakeholders if needed

## Success Criteria
- Plan remains appropriate for problem complexity
- Adjustments are well-justified
- Progress continuity maintained
- Stakeholder alignment achieved
