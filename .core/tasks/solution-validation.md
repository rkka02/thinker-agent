# Solution Validation Task

## Purpose
Systematically validate proposed solutions using multiple validation frameworks and criteria.

## Input Requirements
- Proposed solution(s)
- Original problem definition
- Success criteria and constraints
- Stakeholder requirements
- Available validation methods

## Process
1. **Validation Framework Selection**
   - Choose appropriate validation methods based on problem type
   - Consider: feasibility, desirability, viability analysis
   - Include domain-specific validation criteria

2. **Multi-Criteria Validation**
   - **Technical Validation**: Does it solve the problem?
   - **Feasibility Validation**: Can it be implemented?
   - **Stakeholder Validation**: Does it meet user needs?
   - **Risk Validation**: What could go wrong?
   - **Resource Validation**: Do we have required resources?

3. **Testing Approaches**
   - Thought experiments and scenarios
   - Prototype or pilot validation where possible
   - Expert review and feedback
   - Historical precedent analysis

4. **Validation Synthesis**
   - Integrate validation results
   - Identify solution strengths and weaknesses
   - Recommend solution refinements
   - Document validation evidence

## Output
- Comprehensive validation report
- Solution refinement recommendations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Implementation readiness assessment
- Go/no-go recommendation with rationale

## Success Criteria
- Multiple validation perspectives applied
- Evidence-based validation conclusions
- Clear implementation recommendations
- Stakeholder confidence in solution
