## PHASE 1: COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

**LOAD: .core/utils/complexity-assessor.md** - Detailed assessment methodology and calibration guidance

### Quick Assessment Framework
Evaluate across 5 dimensions (1-4 scale each):

1. **Domain Breadth**: How many disciplines involved? (1=single, 4=multi-domain)
2. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Agreement level? (1=aligned, 4=conflicting)  
3. **Solution Uncertainty**: Path clarity? (1=known solutions, 4=unknown territory)
4. **Impact Scope**: Consequence breadth? (1=local/reversible, 4=strategic/irreversible)
5. **Time Pressure**: Timeline constraints? (1=unlimited, 4=crisis mode)

**Complexity Levels**:
- **Simple (5-8)**: 3-step plan
- **Medium (9-12)**: 5-step plan  
- **Complex (13-16)**: 7-step plan
- **Wicked (17-20)**: 10-step plan

## DEEP ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES

**LOAD: .core/data/mental-models-library.md** - Mental models for deep analysis and pattern recognition

**LOAD: .core/data/cross-domain-patterns.md** - Cross-domain analogies and universal patterns

### First Principles Analysis (Feynman Technique)

**Core Question**: "What are the irreducible truths we can build from?"

#### Step 1: Assumption Stripping
**Process**:
- List all current assumptions about the problem
- For each assumption, ask: "How do we know this is true?"
- Separate facts from beliefs/conventions
- Identify sources and reliability of each "fact"

**Challenge Framework**:
- **Authority**: "Who says this must be true?"
- **Convention**: "Is this just how it's always been done?"
- **Constraint**: "Is this a real limit or self-imposed?"
- **Causation**: "Do we actually know A causes B?"

#### Step 2: Truth Foundation Building
- **Physics/Natural Laws**: What cannot be violated?
- **Mathematical Principles**: What logical relationships hold?
- **Economic Fundamentals**: What resource/incentive realities exist?
- **Human Nature**: What psychological/social constants apply?

#### Step 3: Reconstruction from Fundamentals
- Build understanding from verified truths only
- Question every intermediate step
- Identify where beliefs crept back in
- Create new mental model from first principles

#### Feynman Technique Application
1. **Explain Simply**: Can you explain it to a child?
2. **Identify Gaps**: Where do you use jargon or skip steps?
3. **Simplify Further**: Make it even more basic
4. **Analogize**: What simpler systems behave similarly?

### Root Cause Investigation

#### 5-Why Progression
Start with surface problem, ask "Why?" five times minimum:
1. **Why 1**: Immediate cause identification
2. **Why 2**: Contributing factor analysis  
3. **Why 3**: System/process issues
4. **Why 4**: Organizational/cultural factors
5. **Why 5+**: Fundamental/structural causes

#### Cause Category Framework
- **Human Factors**: Skills, motivation, cognitive biases, communication
- **Process Factors**: Workflows, procedures, decision-making systems
- **System Factors**: Technology, tools, infrastructure, design
- **Environmental Factors**: Context, constraints, external pressures
- **Cultural Factors**: Values, assumptions, unwritten rules

#### Root Cause Validation
- **Evidence Test**: What concrete evidence supports this root cause?
- **Elimination Test**: If this cause were removed, would the problem disappear?
- **Recurrence Test**: Does this cause explain why the problem keeps happening?
- **Scope Test**: Does this cause account for all manifestations of the problem?

#### Systems Thinking Integration
- **Feedback Loops**: What reinforces the problem?
- **Leverage Points**: Where could small changes create big impacts?
- **Unintended Consequences**: What side effects might solutions create?
- **System Boundaries**: What's inside vs. outside our influence?

### Problem Decomposition

#### Hierarchical Breakdown Strategy
- **Level 1**: Overall problem statement
- **Level 2**: Major problem components
- **Level 3**: Sub-problems within each component
- **Level 4**: Specific issues requiring resolution
- **Level 5**: Actionable problem elements

#### Decomposition Dimensions
- **Functional**: What needs to be accomplished?
- **Temporal**: What sequence/timing issues exist?
- **Stakeholder**: Who is affected and how?
- **Resource**: What capabilities/assets are involved?
- **Geographic**: Where does the problem manifest?

#### Interdependency Analysis
- **Sequential Dependencies**: A must happen before B
- **Resource Dependencies**: A and B need same resources
- **Logical Dependencies**: A's solution affects B's parameters
- **Stakeholder Dependencies**: Same people involved in A and B

### Decision Analysis

**LOAD: .core/templates/decision-templates.yaml** - Multi-criteria decision frameworks and evaluation matrices

#### Multi-Criteria Decision Framework

**Decision Architecture**:
- **Decision Type**: Strategic, tactical, operational, emergency
- **Stakes Level**: High, medium, low consequences
- **Reversibility**: Easily changed, difficult to change, irreversible
- **Time Pressure**: Immediate, short-term, long-term planning
- **Information State**: Complete, partial, uncertain, unknown

**Stakeholder Analysis**:
- **Primary**: Directly affected by decision outcomes
- **Secondary**: Indirectly affected or influential  
- **Key Players**: High influence on decision implementation
- **Veto Players**: Can block decision implementation

**Option Generation & Evaluation**:
- **Status Quo**: Continue current approach
- **Incremental**: Small modifications to current approach
- **Alternative**: Different approach, similar goals
- **Radical**: Fundamentally different approach
- **Exit**: Stop/abandon current direction

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Effectiveness**: Will it achieve desired outcomes?
- **Feasibility**: Can we actually implement it?
- **Efficiency**: Best use of available resources?
- **Risk Level**: What could go wrong and how likely?
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Who wins/loses and how much?

5. **Continuation Decision**: Determine if additional iteration needed

### Iterative Continuation Triggers

**Continue Thinking If**:
- Success criteria not fully met for current step
- Critical knowledge gaps remain unaddressed
- User requests deeper analysis or additional perspectives

- Cross-domain insights suggest additional angles to explore

**Complete Thinking If**:
- All step success criteria achieved
- User confirms sufficient depth reached
- Key insights captured and validated
- Implementation pathway clear
- Risks and uncertainties adequately addressed

### Adaptive Iteration Strategies

**Depth Iteration**: Dive deeper into current step with additional methods
**Breadth Iteration**: Explore adjacent topics or perspectives  
**Method Iteration**: Apply different thinking frameworks to same problem
**Research Iteration**: Conduct additional web searches for missing information
**Validation Iteration**: Test insights with different approaches or evidence

### Progress Tracking Through Iterations

**Iteration Log**:
- Track number of iterations per step
- Document reason for each additional iteration
