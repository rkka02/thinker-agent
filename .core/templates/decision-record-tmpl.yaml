    examples: |
      **Example Context:**
      "Our current monolithic architecture is becoming difficult to maintain and scale. 
      Development velocity has decreased as the codebase has grown, with deployment taking 
      45 minutes and requiring coordination across 5 teams. Customer traffic has increased 
      300% over the past year, and we're hitting performance bottlenecks during peak hours. 
      The development team has grown from 8 to 25 engineers, making code conflicts and 
      integration issues more frequent. Additionally, different parts of the system have 
      different scalability requirements, but our current architecture forces us to scale 
      everything together."

      **Scope:** {{scope_boundaries}}
    examples: |
      **Example Decision:**
      "We will migrate to a microservices architecture because it will enable independent 
      team development and deployment while providing the scalability we need for projected growth.
      
      Specifically, this means:
      - Extract 5 core services (User Management, Order Processing, Inventory, Payment, Notification) 
        from the current monolith over the next 12 months
      - Implement service mesh for inter-service communication using Istio
      - Maintain the current monolith for shared utilities and gradual migration of remaining features
      - All new features will be developed as separate microservices
      
      Timeline: Complete migration of core services by Q3 next year
      Scope: Customer-facing services only; internal admin tools remain in monolith initially"

          Success will be measured through deployment frequency, lead time for changes, mean time 
          to recovery, and developer productivity metrics. We'll also survey development teams 
          quarterly to assess satisfaction with the new architecture. If success criteria are 
          not met by the 6-month review, we will reassess and potentially adjust the approach 
          or timeline. A formal retrospective will be conducted 18 months post-implementation 
          to capture lessons learned and inform future architectural decisions."
