# Complexity Assessor Utility

## Purpose
Provide systematic assessment of problem complexity across five dimensions to determine appropriate thinking depth and approach.

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Dimension Analysis

**For each dimension (Domain, Stakeholder, Solution Space, Constraint, Uncertainty):**
1. Gather relevant information
2. Identify key characteristics
3. Compare against scale descriptors
4. Assign numerical score (1-5)
5. Document reasoning and evidence

### Step 2: Pattern Recognition

**Look for complexity indicators:**
- Multiple interacting systems
- Conflicting stakeholder interests  
- Novel problem characteristics
- High uncertainty levels
- Changing constraint environment

### Step 3: Total Score Calculation

**Sum individual dimension scores:**
- Simple: 5-8 total
- Medium: 9-12 total  
- Complex: 13-16 total
- Wicked: 17-20+ total

### Step 4: Classification Validation

**Check classification against:**
- Problem examples at each level
- Time investment implications
- Resource requirements
- Success probability patterns

## Assessment Guidelines

### Dimension Scoring Tips

**Domain Complexity**
- Count number of disciplines involved
- Assess knowledge base maturity
- Evaluate domain interaction complexity
- Consider novelty of domain combination

**Stakeholder Complexity**
- Map all affected parties
- Assess interest alignment/conflict
- Evaluate power dynamics
- Consider hidden stakeholders

**Solution Space Complexity**
- Research existing solutions
- Assess innovation requirements
- Evaluate implementation difficulty
- Consider success rate patterns

**Constraint Complexity**
- List all known constraints
- Identify constraint interactions
- Assess constraint stability
- Look for paradoxical requirements

**Uncertainty Complexity**
- Evaluate predictability
- Assess data availability
- Consider environmental volatility
- Identify unknown unknowns

### Common Assessment Errors

**Underestimation Patterns**
- Familiar problems assumed simple
- Stakeholder complexity overlooked
- Hidden constraints not considered
- Uncertainty minimized due to overconfidence

**Overestimation Patterns**
- Novel aspects overweighted
- Standard solutions not recognized
- Constraints assumed more rigid than reality
- Uncertainty exaggerated due to risk aversion

### Calibration Techniques

**Reference Examples**
- Use problem libraries for comparison
- Benchmark against solved problems
- Consider organizational complexity experience
- Apply peer review for critical assessments

**Validation Methods**
- Multiple assessor scoring
- Historical outcome correlation
- Expert review and feedback
- Reassessment after initial analysis

## Dynamic Assessment

### Reassessment Triggers
- New stakeholders discovered
- Constraint changes identified
- Solution attempts reveal complexity
- Environmental shifts occur
- Time pressure changes significantly

### Complexity Evolution
- Problems may increase/decrease in complexity
- New information affects assessment
- Constraint discovery common
- Solution attempts provide learning

### Adaptive Response
- Adjust thinking approach accordingly
- Scale resources to match complexity
- Modify methods for new complexity level
- Update stakeholder communication
