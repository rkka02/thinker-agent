- Support: Basic validation techniques
- Focus: Efficient execution

**Medium (5 steps)**
- Primary: 1-2 methods per step
- Support: Cross-validation between methods
- Focus: Thorough analysis

**Complex (7 steps)**
- Primary: 2-3 methods per step
- Support: Multiple validation approaches
- Focus: Deep understanding

**Wicked (10 steps)**
- Primary: Multiple methods per step
- Support: Continuous validation and adaptation
- Focus: Emergent understanding

### By Domain Characteristics

**Technical Domains**
- Systems thinking

## Selection Process

1. **Problem Characterization**
   - Identify primary domain(s)
   - Assess problem type (analytical, creative, decision)
   - Determine complexity level

2. **Method Pool Generation**
   - List applicable methods by domain
   - Filter by problem type
   - Adjust for complexity level

3. **Method Selection**
   - Choose primary methods for each step
   - Select supporting/validation methods
   - Ensure method diversity where beneficial

4. **Adaptation Guidelines**
   - Modify methods for specific context
   - Combine methods when appropriate
   - Plan for method switching if needed

## Common Method Combinations

**Analysis + Creativity**
- Root cause analysis → TRIZ innovation
- Systems analysis → Design thinking
- Problem decomposition → Lateral thinking

**Multiple Perspectives**
- First principles + Systems thinking
- Stakeholder analysis + Technical analysis
- Quantitative + Qualitative methods

**Validation Combinations**
- Multiple analytical approaches
- Expert review + Data analysis
- Theoretical + Empirical validation
