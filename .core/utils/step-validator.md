# Step Validator Utility

## Purpose
Validate completion of thinking steps before progression to ensure systematic and thorough problem-solving process.

## Validation Framework

### Completion Criteria Types

**Objective Completion**
- All planned activities completed
- Required outputs produced
- Time allocation met or justified
- Method execution documented

**Quality Completion**
- Success criteria substantially met
- Output quality meets standards
- Validation evidence sufficient
- Stakeholder acceptance achieved

**Learning Completion**
- Key insights captured
- Understanding advanced
- Assumptions tested
- Knowledge gaps identified

### Step Validation Process

**Phase 1: Output Review**
1. Check all required outputs produced
2. Verify output completeness and quality
3. Confirm method execution as planned
4. Document any variations or adaptations

**Phase 2: Criteria Assessment**
1. Evaluate against predefined success criteria
2. Rate achievement level (Complete/Partial/Insufficient)
3. Identify gaps or deficiencies
4. Document evidence supporting assessment

**Phase 3: Learning Validation**
1. Confirm insights captured and documented
2. Verify understanding progression
3. Check assumption testing completion
4. Identify knowledge gained and gaps remaining

**Phase 4: Progression Decision**
1. Determine if step sufficiently complete
2. Identify any rework requirements
3. Approve progression to next step
4. Update plan if necessary

## Validation Levels

### Complete Validation
- All success criteria fully met
- High-quality outputs produced
- Strong supporting evidence
- Clear learning outcomes
- **Action**: Proceed to next step

### Partial Validation
- Most success criteria met
- Adequate output quality
- Some supporting evidence
- Learning objectives partially met
- **Action**: Proceed with noted limitations

### Insufficient Validation
- Key success criteria unmet
- Output quality below standards
- Limited supporting evidence
- Minimal learning achieved
- **Action**: Rework required before progression

## Context-Specific Validation

### By Complexity Level

**Simple Problems**
- Basic output completion sufficient
- Single validation method acceptable
- Minimal evidence requirements
- Efficient progression prioritized

**Medium Problems**
- Multiple validation checks required
- Cross-validation between methods
- Moderate evidence standards
- Balance efficiency with thoroughness

**Complex Problems**
- Comprehensive validation required
- Multiple evidence sources needed
- High quality standards applied
- Thorough documentation essential

**Wicked Problems**
- Adaptive validation criteria
- Emergent evidence standards
- Continuous validation approach
- Learning-focused assessment

### By Step Type

**Analysis Steps**
- Evidence quality and sufficiency
- Logic and reasoning soundness
- Alternative perspectives considered
- Bias recognition and mitigation

**Creative Steps**
- Option generation quantity and quality
- Novelty and feasibility balance
- Evaluation criteria application
- Selection rationale documentation

**Decision Steps**
- Criteria clarity and completeness
- Option evaluation thoroughness
- Trade-off analysis depth
- Decision rationale strength

**Synthesis Steps**
- Integration completeness
- Coherence of understanding
- Insight generation quality
- Action plan clarity

## Validation Tools

### Checklists
- Step-specific completion checklists
- Quality criteria verification
- Evidence documentation requirements
- Learning outcome confirmation

### Rubrics
- Quality scoring frameworks
- Evidence evaluation standards
- Learning assessment criteria
- Progression readiness indicators

### Peer Review
- Expert evaluation protocols
- Stakeholder feedback mechanisms
- Cross-validation approaches
- Bias detection methods

## Common Validation Challenges

### Over-Validation
- Perfectionism blocking progression
- Analysis paralysis
- Diminishing returns on additional validation
- **Mitigation**: Define "sufficient" standards

### Under-Validation
- Rushing to next step
- Insufficient evidence gathering
- Quality shortcuts
- **Mitigation**: Enforce minimum standards

### Validation Bias
- Confirmation bias in evidence interpretation
- Sunk cost bias in quality assessment
- Overconfidence in validation judgment
- **Mitigation**: Multiple validators, devil's advocate
