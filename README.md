# Thinker - Universal Cognitive Assistant

A powerful thinking and problem-solving agent that works across any domain - science, philosophy, personal decisions, creative projects, academic research, mathematical problems, artistic challenges, and life decisions.

## What Thinker Does

**🧠 Universal Thinking (`/thinker` then `*think`)**
- **5-Layer Cognitive Framework**: Polya + Computational + Lateral + Systems + Conceptual thinking
- **Adaptive Depth**: 3-10 steps based on problem complexity
- **Cross-Domain Research**: Real-time web research for current best practices
- **Simple Workflow**: Confirm plan → automatic execution → comprehensive insights

**🚀 Universal Solution Generation (`/thinker` then `*solve`)**
- **4 Solution Categories**: Conceptual, Methodological, Structural, Operational
- **Progressive Evolution**: 2-5 cycles of solution refinement
- **Multiple Methodologies**: Morphological analysis + Creative Problem Solving + Synectics + Scientific method
- **Universal Application**: Works across all domains and fields

## Quick Start

1. **Activate Thinker**: Type `/thinker` in Claude Code
2. **For Systematic Analysis**: Use `*think` with your problem
3. **For Solution Generation**: Use `*solve` with your challenge
4. **Check Progress**: Use `*status` anytime
5. **Get Help**: Use `*help` for guidance

## Universal Applications

- **🔬 Scientific Research**: Hypothesis development, experimental design, theory building
- **🤔 Philosophical Inquiry**: Conceptual analysis, argument construction, ethical reasoning
- **🎯 Personal Decisions**: Life choices, goal setting, relationship decisions, career planning
- **🎨 Creative Projects**: Artistic development, design challenges, innovation breakthroughs
- **📚 Academic Investigation**: Research problems, thesis development, scholarly analysis
- **📐 Mathematical Problems**: Proof development, problem-solving strategies
- **🎭 Artistic Challenges**: Creative expression, aesthetic decisions, artistic vision
- **🌱 Life Decisions**: Personal growth, value clarification, major life transitions

## Simple Usage Examples

**Thinking Example**:
```
You: "/thinker"
Thinker: "Hello! I'm your Universal Cognitive Assistant..."
You: "*think How should I approach my PhD research topic selection?"
Thinker: "5-step thinking plan generated. Execute automatically? Yes/No/Adjust"
You: "Yes"
Thinker: [Executes 5 thinking steps with cross-domain research and insights]
```

**Solution Example**:
```
You: "*solve I need to design a better morning routine"
Thinker: "3-cycle solution evolution planned. Execute? Yes/No/Adjust"
You: "Yes" 
Thinker: [Generates, refines, and optimizes solutions using multiple methodologies]
```

## Why Universal?

- **Domain-Agnostic**: Same powerful frameworks work for any field
- **Fine-Tunable**: Automatically adapts to your specific domain
- **Cross-Pollination**: Discovers insights by connecting across fields
- **Proven Methodologies**: Built on time-tested universal frameworks (Polya, CPS, Synectics, etc.)
- **Research-Enhanced**: Real-time integration of current knowledge and best practices

Transform any challenge into systematic progress with the power of universal cognitive frameworks! 🧠✨
