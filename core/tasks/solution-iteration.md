# Solution Iteration - Progressive Solution Refinement

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

Apply iterative solution refinement cycles that progressively improve solutions through review, critique, and enhancement. Each cycle builds on previous insights to create increasingly sophisticated solutions.

**CORE PRINCIPLE**: Solutions evolve through systematic iteration - each cycle reveals new insights and improvement opportunities.

## Method Description

**Universal Solution Generation System (USGS)**: Domain-agnostic iterative solution evolution integrating morphological analysis, creative problem solving, synectics, scientific method, and universal solution categories applicable across all fields - science, philosophy, personal decisions, creative projects, academic research.

**Key Innovation**: Orchestrates multiple universal solution generation frameworks across complexity-adaptive cycles to create breakthrough solutions applicable to any domain. Each iteration applies systematic methodologies from proven universal problem-solving traditions.
