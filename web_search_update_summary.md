# Web Search Query Updates Summary

## Overview
Updated the thinker agent to use intelligent, adaptive web search queries instead of template-based patterns with placeholders.

## Changes Made

### 1. Web Search Pattern Transformation

**Before (Template-based):**
```
- **Web Search**: "domain-agnostic best practices {focus question keywords}"
- **Web Search**: "{step methods} current approaches field experts"  
- **Web Search**: "metacognitive strategies {focus area} universal thinking frameworks"
```

**After (Intelligent):**
```
- **Web Search**: Formulate intelligent queries to find domain-agnostic best practices relevant to the current focus question and step methods
- **Web Search**: Research current approaches and expert insights for the methodologies being applied
- **Web Search**: Discover metacognitive strategies and universal thinking frameworks applicable to the focus area
```

### 2. Files Updated

#### `/Users/mw/Desktop/thinker-agent/.core/tasks/execute-step.md`
- **Patterns replaced:** 6 web search patterns
- **Changes:** Converted template-style queries with `{placeholder}` syntax to intelligent natural language instructions
- **Impact:** Agent now formulates contextually appropriate search queries based on the specific problem and step being executed

#### `/Users/mw/Desktop/thinker-agent/.core/tasks/solution-iteration.md`  
- **Patterns replaced:** 45+ web search patterns
- **Changes:** Replaced comprehensive set of solution generation web search templates with adaptive query instructions
- **Impact:** Agent can now intelligently research solutions across all phases of iterative solution development

#### `/Users/mw/Desktop/thinker-agent/.core/templates/decision-record-tmpl.yaml`
- **Patterns replaced:** 8 date references containing "2024"
- **Changes:** Updated example dates to be non-year-specific (e.g., "Jan 15" instead of "2024-01-15")
- **Impact:** Template examples are now timeless and won't become outdated

## Benefits of Changes

### 1. Adaptive Intelligence
- Agent can now formulate search queries based on actual problem context
- Search terms adapt to specific domain, complexity, and methodology being used
- More relevant and targeted research results

### 2. Context Awareness  
- Queries automatically incorporate the current step's focus and methods
- Search strategy adapts to problem complexity and domain characteristics
- Better integration with cross-domain thinking approaches

### 3. Natural Language Understanding
- Instructions guide the agent to think about what information is needed
- More flexible and intelligent approach than rigid templates
- Enables creative and contextual query formulation

### 4. Future-Proof Design
- No hardcoded years or specific timeframes that become outdated
- Adaptable to new domains and methodologies without template updates
- Scales with agent's growing capabilities

## Verification

✅ All template-style web search patterns removed (0 instances of `Web Search.*{.*}` found)
✅ All 2024 references removed (0 instances found)  
✅ Intelligent query instructions implemented across all relevant files
✅ Agent can now formulate contextually appropriate search queries

## Example Transformation

**Original Template Approach:**
```
- **Web Search**: "morphological analysis applications {problem domain} breakthrough cases"
```

**New Intelligent Approach:**  
```
- **Web Search**: Research morphological analysis applications and breakthrough cases for the problem domain
```

The agent now intelligently determines:
- What specific aspects of morphological analysis are relevant
- How to incorporate the actual problem domain into the query
- What types of breakthrough cases would be most valuable
- How to phrase queries for optimal search results

## Impact on Agent Behavior

The thinker agent now:
1. **Thinks before searching** - Considers what information is needed for the current context
2. **Adapts queries dynamically** - Uses actual problem characteristics, not placeholders  
3. **Maintains cross-domain focus** - Formulates queries that explore universal principles and patterns
4. **Operates timelessly** - No hardcoded dates or years that become obsolete

This represents a significant upgrade from template-based to intelligence-based web research capabilities.
